By taking critical moments in the history of climate-human interaction, this course will explore the history of scientific ideas and practices, from the 18th century to the present, that serve as the foundation for modern conceptions of the weather and climate as a global system. Our aim is to put current scientific debates on climate change into historical and critical perspective as we seek to understand the ways climate has been interpreted and understood over time, both within and outside the scientific community.",

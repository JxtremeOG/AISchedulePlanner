        "courseDesc": "The goals of this course are to introduce basic theory of deep learning in data science applications, to understand how deep learning algorithms work at a high level, and to apply deep learning algorithms to key data science problems in different disciplines. The course introduces all relevant topics in deep learning: neural networks, backpropagation, convolution neural networks, recurrent neural networks and deep reinforcement learning. Students will be exposed to various representative algorithms in the concept level and learn their trade-offs. Students will gain hands-on experiences with assignments and a term project. Students will be prepared to attack new problems using various deep learning methods.",

        "courseDesc": "This class examines the economic and political events of the U.S. in the 19th, 20th and early 21st centuries. The course combines economics, politics, and history to get a wide (but by no means comprehensive) view of the issues, politics, and events that have shaped the course of the US economy for the last 100+ years. Special attention will be given to economic panics and crises and how financial markets respond to calamity, including what gave rise to panics and crises, and their aftermath, along with a study of how they shaped future institutions, regulations, and policy.",

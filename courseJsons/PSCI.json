This course is designed to gain leverage on the processes that explain this rapid global expansion of LGBT rights by surveying an eclectic literature on comparative and transnational LGBT politics. Specially, we will ask: What factors have facilitated the mobilization of LGBT people? How and why have public opinion and laws towards LGBT people changed differently across various countries? To answer these questions, we will take an in-depth empirical look at movements representing LGBT people and their successes/losses\u2014as well as those of their opposition\u2014across time and place, from the late 1800s to present day and across the globe.",

        "courseDesc": "This course is an introduction to systems engineering. Systems engineering covers a higher level system concept, applying well tested engineering practices to address the processes which are critical to most large engineering efforts, and optimizing them for effectiveness and financial success. This course covers the complete system engineering process, touching on the many facets of engineering systems from needs and requirements generation to production to system operation. Students will learn to apply the systems processes and acquire skills to integrate user needs, manage requirements, conduct technological evaluation and build elaborate systems architectures.",

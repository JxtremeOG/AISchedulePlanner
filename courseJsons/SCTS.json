This course is an introduction to how political, social, and economic factors shape the development of scientific concepts, medical practices, and technological designs and vice versa. We will also discuss the political effects of scientific knowledge and specific technologies, exploring the costs and benefits of current techno-scientific arrangements.",

Such an approach investigates the social, political and economic factors that lead to the politicization of addiction, and also the strategies that government and nongovernment entities use to address the problem of addiction. We will pay particular attention to how the politics of addiction intersects with questions of race, class, and gender. Various iterations of this course will cover the same key concepts and frameworks, but the choice of case studies of different substances may vary. Topics to be covered could include, for example, opioid addiction, internet addiction, tobacco and cigarettes, and/or alcohol policy and cultures of recovery.",

We will examine structures of injustice and how technology can reinforce, worsen, or mitigate them. We will look at the impacts of concrete design choices\u2014and design processes\u2014on various indicators of social justice. And we will learn from examples of self-conscious attempts by innovators to create technology with social justice aims in mind.",

This course will examine the origins of AI as well as the social orders and cultural practices involved in recent developments. It will explore its potential effects on society, the human psyche and the medical engineering of the body. Finally, the ethical and political implications of AI will be examined. Specific topics discussed will include: virtual words; the uploading of brains into computers; golems, monsters and posthumans; dreams of immortality; smartness and intelligence; bots and online contagion; machine learning, its impact and limits.",

In this seminar, we will explore how definitions and experiences of health and illness are shaped by technology use, cultural contexts, institutional practices, health care policies, and inequalities. We will examine social trends in medical technology and science as well as how illness categories are created, negotiated, and resisted. Participants in this course will gain the ability to assess the changing role of science and technology in medicine as well as think critically about the social dimensions of the experience of health and illness.",

The survey will include an analysis of energy infrastructures in relation to environmental justice; energy policy in relation to the housing crisis; and energy technologies in relation to efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. A core part of this course will be development of a portfolio, through in-class micro-assignments. Each weekly class will be divided into discussion of the assigned readings, project-based learning, group work, and media analysis.",

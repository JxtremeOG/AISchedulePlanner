Students form a team and challenge a real-world project of their choices. Each team selects a domain and a data set, and then applies a data science approach to actual situations for real-world decision making. Each team is required to come up with a scientific question with a business value, perform an explorative data analysis, develop a data science model, evaluate the results, and communicate the results with audience.",

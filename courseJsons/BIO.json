As study of autism has increased over the past several decades, it has become clear that autism actually comprises a large, heterogeneous set of similar disorders, most of which are genetic in origin. In this class, we will study how neuronal cell biology is disrupted in known forms of autism, and how distinct forms of autism can arise from alterations in common cellular pathways. Further, we will discuss how these discoveries may lead to eventual treatments or cures.",

Yet Christianity was originally a development within Judaism, a sect, so to speak, of Judaism. The earliest Christians were Jewish followers of a Jewish leader and conceived of themselves as faithful Jews. So how did the two religions come to be viewed as opposed? Do elements of Judaism remain as part of the foundation of the new faith of Christianity? Where do the two faiths converge and where do they diverge?
